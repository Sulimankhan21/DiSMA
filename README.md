# DiSMA - Differential Solver for Matlab Applications
DiSMA is a library implemented in for the test of 1D and 2D numerical models using Finite Element Method (FEM), Finite Volume Method (FVM) and Finite Difference Method (FDM).

The project is developed as a requirement for the course of __Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations__ in the MSc programme in Engineering Mathematics at Politecnico di Torino.

The solver is based on the *bbtr30* triangulator, developed by Prof. Berrone of the Dept. of Mathematics at Politecnico di Torino.
